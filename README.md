# Welcome to our code FUSS!

Our code For Use with Superova Spectropolarimetry (FUSS) was written to facilitate the data reduction and analysis of spectropolarimetric data. It includes several IRAF CL routines as well as a Python 2.7 package (a list of the pre-required packages can be found in the documentation).

The documentation can be found in the form of our [wiki](https://github.com/HeloiseS/FUSS/wiki), or the PDF file [FUSS.pdf](https://github.com/HeloiseS/FUSS/blob/master/DOC/FUSS.pdf).

FUSS was used to reduce and analyse the data for our paper on SN 2014ad, which can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.06270.pdf).
