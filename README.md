# Welcome to our code FUSS!

Our code __For Use with Superova Spectropolarimetry__ (FUSS) was written to facilitate the data reduction and analysis of spectropolarimetric data. It includes several IRAF CL routines as well as a Python 2.7 package (a list of the pre-required packages can be found in the documentation).

The documentation can be found in the form of our [wiki](https://github.com/HeloiseS/FUSS/wiki), or the PDF file [FUSS.pdf](https://github.com/HeloiseS/FUSS/blob/master/DOC/FUSS.pdf).

FUSS v1.0 was used to reduce and analyse the data for our paper on SN 2014ad, which can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.06270.pdf).
